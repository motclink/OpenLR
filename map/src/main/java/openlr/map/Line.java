/**
 * The Interface Line is a one-dimensional representation of a road or part of road in a road network. 
 * A line starts and ends at a node. It is directed, this means two-way traffic flow is represented by 
 * two (directed) lines, one per direction. A line is not abstracted by the airline between start and 
 * end node, it rather "knows" its geometry. Additional information on that line includes its functional
 * road class and its form of way. Since the line is part of a network, its predecessors and successors are
 * also accessible if available.
